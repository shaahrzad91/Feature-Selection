# Feature-Selection
*C2_W2_Lab_3_Feature_Selection*

I am going to explain various methods of feature selection in supervised Algorithms:
1) Filter Method
    - Correlation : (the relationship between the features and the labels eg . Pearson correlation)
    - Univariate feature selection with SK-learn
2) Wrapper Method
    - Forward elimination : (iterative and greedy method)
    - backward elimination
    - Recursive feature selection : ( start with one model to reach the important features )
3) Embedded Method
    - L1 Regularization : ( L1 or lasso regularization introduces a penalty term to the loss function which leads to the least important features being eliminated )   
    - Feature Importance with Sk-learn
