# Feature-Selection

I am going to explain various methods of feature selection in supervised Algorithms:
1) Filter Method
2)    - Correlation : (the relationship between the features and the labels eg . Pearson correlation)
3)    - Univariate feature selection with SK-learn
4) Wrapper Method
5)    - Forward elimination : (iterative and greedy method)
6)    - backward elimination
7)    - Recursive feature selection : ( start with one model to reach the important features )
8) Embedded Method
9)    - L1 Regularization : ( L1 or lasso regularization introduces a penalty term to the loss function which leads to the least important features being eliminated )   
10)   - Feature Importance with Sk-learn
